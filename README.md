# Vector-Space-Search-Model
Information Retrival

Implemented the Backend: created backend.py, which acts as the core of your search engine. It processes your document corpus, builds an index, and calculates relevance scores for each document based on a query. I specifically implemented the Vector Space Model with the lnc.ltc weighting scheme and cosine similarity to rank the documents. I also added a Soundex algorithm for phonetic matching.

Built the Frontend: created app.py using the Streamlit library. This file serves as the user interface, allowing users to input a query and view the ranked search results.

Deployed the App: By uploading code to GitHub and connecting it to Streamlit Community Cloud,making my application publicly accessible on the internet.
