# Vector-Space-Search-Model
Information Retrival

Implemented the Backend: You created backend.py, which acts as the core of your search engine. It processes your document corpus, builds an index, and calculates relevance scores for each document based on a query. You specifically implemented the Vector Space Model with the lnc.ltc weighting scheme and cosine similarity to rank the documents. You also added a Soundex algorithm for phonetic matching.

Built the Frontend: You created app.py using the Streamlit library. This file serves as the user interface, allowing users to input a query and view the ranked search results. You recently improved the UI to be cleaner and more organized with a new layout and collapsible results.

Deployed the App: By uploading your code to GitHub and connecting it to Streamlit Community Cloud, you are making your application publicly accessible on the internet. This process handles all the technical aspects of hosting, allowing anyone to use your search engine via a web URL.
